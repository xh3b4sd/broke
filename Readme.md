# Broke

  Broke is just a layer for vowsjs, to make your tests
  a little bit nicer. So you can define your own process
  phases and custom assertions, that make your tests smarter.
  Configure your test cases and decide how often a test
  have to repeat, when a test have to time out and so on.

  Further there is a custom processor given to test requests
  easily.



## Installation:

  Install broke locally to get "var broke = require('broke')"
  to work. Install it globally to make the test runner
  working and you can do "broke example_test.js --spec".

    $ npm install broke
    $ sudo npm install broke -g



## Usage:

  For better documentation and usage look for the examples.
  They are well commented.



## Tests:

    $ vows node_modules/broke/tests/cases/* --spec
